# Fluxheim 1.5.20 Release Notes

Fluxheim 1.5.20 starts the web, PHP-FPM, and cache boundary-preparation line
and carries forward the post-1.5.19 trusted-proxy validation fix.

## Changed

- Started the `fluxheim-cache` crate boundary by moving shared cache-header
  request/response directive parsing into `crates/fluxheim-cache`. The root
  crate keeps `crate::cache_headers` as a compatibility re-export, so runtime
  behavior and call sites are unchanged.
- Started the `fluxheim-web` crate boundary by moving static directory-listing
  data/rendering helpers into `crates/fluxheim-web`. The root `crate::web`
  module re-exports the same types and renderer while keeping Pingora response
  serving in the root adapter.
- Started the `fluxheim-php-fpm` crate boundary by moving PHP-FPM timeout
  classification and bounded error-outcome helpers into
  `crates/fluxheim-php-fpm`, with the root PHP-FPM module re-exporting the same
  names for existing runtime and test code.

## Fixed

- Allowed real provider IPv6 trusted-proxy ranges such as Cloudflare's
  `2a06:98c0::/29`. The `1.5.19` config-crate split preserved runtime IPv6
  CIDR support but made config validation too strict by rejecting trusted proxy
  IPv6 prefixes broader than `/32`.
