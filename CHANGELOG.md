# Changelog

All notable Fluxheim changes should be recorded here before a release tag is
created.

Fluxheim follows semantic versioning once `1.0.0` is released. Before `1.0.0`,
minor versions may still change configuration shape, feature names, and runtime
behavior when the change improves security or project direction.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `1.0` gateway migration fixtures and smoke coverage for representative
  multi-site configs, including canonical redirects, app proxy vhosts, custom
  error pages, static aliases, challenge exceptions, and multi-subdomain
  route/proxy layouts.
- Route-level exact, prefix, and fallback matching with proxy, static, and
  redirect actions.
- Route prefix stripping, per-route request body limits, and route-local
  upstream connect/read/send timeout policy.
- Websocket-safe upgrade proxying coverage for `/chat/`-style routes.
- Vhost ACME challenge helper for standard cleartext challenge paths while
  preserving HTTPS redirects for normal traffic.
- Vhost canonical redirect helper for apex/secondary-host redirects that preserve
  the request URI safely.
- Custom upstream error pages with internal static serving.
- Static alias routes with secure optional directory listing and local-time
  timestamp rendering.
- Safe dynamic request-header templates for common proxy migrations.
- SNI certificate selection for the default rustls downstream TLS backend and
  callback-capable downstream TLS backends.
- Native systemd deployment files, sysusers/tmpfiles packaging, and manual
  server preparation helper for compiled binaries.
- Zeroizing admin-token buffers and `subtle`-backed constant-time admin bearer
  token verification.
- SBOM generation and local reproducible-build checks in the stable release
  gate and CI supply-chain evidence.

## 0.5.0 - Basic Sites Preview

Released: 2026-05-06

### Added

- GitHub CI, Dependabot, CodeQL, dependency policy, and release-check scripts.
- Feature preflight validation for mutually exclusive TLS backends and
  zero-retention privacy-mode incompatibilities.
- `profile-*` Cargo feature aliases for common build profiles.
- Dedicated `1.0` core build matrix validation for default, profile, web-only,
  and proxy-only builds.
- Stable release security gate script for local release validation.
- Deep stable-release gate wrapper for release-candidate validation.
- Release-gate report capture helper for local release-note artifacts.
- Stable release-notes template covering gate results, reviewed advisories, and
  container image metadata.
- Production-readiness checklist separating the `1.0` stable-core promise from
  incubator and future modules.
- Vhost config guide explaining TOML `[[vhosts]]` ownership and the recommended
  one-vhost-per-file layout.
- User-friendly header mutation aliases: `remove`/`add` and nested
  `[headers.*.operations]` tables, while keeping `unset`/`set` compatible.
- Config validation rejects ambiguous header additions where the same header is
  defined in more than one `set`, `add`, or `operations.add` table.
- Config validation rejects proxy blocks that define both the compatibility
  `upstream` field and the preferred `upstreams` list.
- Optional `hey` based `1.0` local load-smoke script.
- Raw-socket request-framing smoke for malformed HTTP rejection before release.
- Initial `cargo-fuzz` targets for Host normalization and cache-header parsing.
- Fuzz target compile validation helper for release gates.
- Local `testssl.sh` TLS scan wrapper for scanner-backed release validation.
- `1.0` localhost smoke coverage for HTTP static hosting, HTTP proxying, static
  certificate storage validation, HTTPS static hosting, HTTPS proxying, and
  optional cleartext-to-HTTPS redirect.
- Global `[server.https_redirect]` option with safe Host validation and
  restricted redirect statuses.
- Wolfi, Alpine, SUSE Micro, and Debian runtime Containerfiles.
- Container image publish workflow for GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub.
- Self-contained packaged default site and config so fresh containers/RPMs
  serve `/srv/fluxheim/index.html` on port `8080` without external assets.
- RPM packaging spec for RHEL/openSUSE-style builds from vendored Cargo
  dependencies.
- Runtime UID/GID build args for container images, defaulting to non-root
  `65532:65532` while allowing deliberate root-runtime images.
- Zero-retention privacy example config for `profile-privacy` builds.

### Changed

- Removed the advanced CodeQL workflow so GitHub CodeQL default setup can own
  code scanning without duplicate SARIF upload failures.
- Updated the optional OpenSSL TLS backend lockfile path to `openssl 0.10.79`
  and `openssl-sys 0.9.115`.
- Centralized temporary test path creation so CodeQL does not treat descriptive
  test labels as filesystem-controlled path input.
- The default build is `proxy`, `web`, `cache`, `tls-rustls`, and `security`.
- Container builds can select both feature set and packaged config.
- CI now separates the stable `1.0` core matrix from incubator-module feature
  checks.
- Container publishing uses variant-suffixed tags such as `v1.0.0-wolfi` and
  `latest-alpine`.
- Roadmap now tracks a future declarative redirect and rewrite engine with
  match-action routing, loop detection, and safe URL handling.
- Release ladder now focuses `1.1` on TLS policy hardening before operational
  and load-balancing modules graduate.
- Process runtime paths now default to `/run/fluxheim` instead of predictable
  files directly under `/tmp`.
- Examples now prefer `upstreams = [...]`; the single `upstream` field remains
  supported for compatibility.

### Security

- Path and header handling are treated as release-gated areas with tests and
  CodeQL scanning.
- Static file serving now rejects same-size file replacement between resolution
  and body read on Unix by checking the opened file handle identity.
- Process PID, upgrade-socket, and process error-log paths are rejected on Unix
  when their nearest existing parent directory is world-writable.
- File logging paths are rejected on Unix when their nearest existing parent
  directory is world-writable.
- Disk cache roots are rejected on Unix when their nearest existing parent
  directory is world-writable.
- Admin token files, configured snapshot stores, and direct snapshot store roots
  are rejected on Unix when they would use a world-writable directory.
- TLS certificate paths, ACME storage paths, and ACME EAB secret file paths are
  rejected on Unix when their nearest existing parent directory is
  world-writable, including in the dedicated TLS storage checker.
- `privacy-mode` rejects access logging and cannot be combined with `cache` or
  `metrics`.
- CodeQL uses the supported Rust `build-mode: none` setup.

### Notes

- This is a preview release for normal static HTML websites and simple
  whole-vhost proxying with static TLS certificates. It is not the `1.0.0`
  gateway release.
- At the `0.5.0` tag, known `1.0.0` gaps included multi-certificate SNI,
  route-level proxy/static/redirect behavior, websocket-safe proxying,
  per-route limits and timeouts, custom upstream error pages, and secure static
  alias/directory listing behavior.

## 0.1.0 - Repository Baseline

### Added

- Initial Fluxheim Rust/Pingora project baseline.
- Modular static web, reverse proxy, cache, TLS, ACME planning, admin snapshot,
  load-balancer, metrics, logging, and privacy-mode foundations.
- EUPL-1.2 license, GitHub-ready README, roadmap, architecture docs, examples,
  and rootless Podman packaging.
- `deny.toml` and audit policy for license/advisory checks.

### Notes

- This is not a production `1.0` release. The stable `1.0` target remains
  static hosting, reverse proxying, vhosts, rustls TLS, secure defaults, and
  local/rootless Podman operation.
